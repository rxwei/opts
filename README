** LICM
  - The pass is located in LICM.cpp. It follows the pseudocode described in the
    appendix.
  - Function `LICM::doLICM()` contains the main algorithm. 
  - Function `LICM::isLoopInvariant(Instruction&)` determines if instruction is
    loop-invariant
  - Function `LICM::safeToHoise(Instruction&)` determines if instruction is
    safe to hoist outside the loop body

** ADCE
  - The pass is located in ADCE.cpp. It follows the pseudocode described in the
    appendix.
  - Function `ADCE::doADCE()` contains the main algorithm.
  - Function `ADCE::isTriviallyLive(Instruction&)` determines if instruction is
    trivially live
  - Function `ADCE::markLive(Instruction&)` marks the instruction alive and adds
    it to the worklist
